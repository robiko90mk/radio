<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef444fd-642f-4256-a2ae-715526230ef9">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef444fd-642f-4256-a2ae-715526230ef9" width="400">
</a>

---

### 3. Install Visual Studio Code

Download VSCode:
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install with default settings.

---

### 4. Install PlatformIO

Open VSCode and install the PlatformIO IDE extension.

Steps: VSCode → Extensions → search "PlatformIO IDE" → Install

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a742fceb-4126-4d36-aa05-3f6ef462ba91">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a742fceb-4126-4d36-aa05-3f6ef462ba91" width="400">
</a>

After installation restart VSCode.

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7216e432-b2e5-4aba-afcd-fed0c00f2eba">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7216e432-b2e5-4aba-afcd-fed0c00f2eba" width="400">
</a>

After restarting VSCode, wait until PlatformIO finishes installing the required toolchains and dependencies.

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306eb958-1c4a-4460-b51f-1f5e6a6496f7">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306eb958-1c4a-4460-b51f-1f5e6a6496f7" width="400">
</a>

---

### 5. Download & unzip firmware

Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page and select **Download ZIP**.

Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

Create a project folder on your system: (for example: C:\platformio)

From the extracted archive navigate to: yoRadio-main/yoRadio

Copy the **entire contents of this folder** into: C:\platformio

Only the **yoRadio** folder is required. The other folders and files from the ZIP archive are not needed.

In the **yoRadio-main** archive open the folder: **Setup samples**

Select the folder that matches your display type (for example: **ILI9341**).

From the selected folder copy the file: **platformio.ini** into the project folder: **C:\platformio\yoRadio**

Copy your own **myoptions.h** file into the project folder: **C:\platformio\yoRadio**, or use the one in the Setup samples folder, but adapt it to your own hardware!

**The project folder is now ready for use!**

---

### 6. Back to VSCode PlatformIO

In VSCode click the **PlatformIO icon** (ant head) in the left sidebar.

Select **Pick a folder** and open: C:\platformio\yoRadio

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ff6090-ea1b-4b8f-8124-35ab3ff44cbb">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ff6090-ea1b-4b8f-8124-35ab3ff44cbb" width="400">
</a>

After opening the project, wait until PlatformIO finishes preparing the environment and installing all required tools and dependencies for the project.

This process may take **5–10 minutes** on the first run.

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56afa0d7-f8e1-432d-a8b9-19814817e61f">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56afa0d7-f8e1-432d-a8b9-19814817e61f" width="400">
</a>

The setup is complete when there are no more PlatformIO messages in the bottom status bar or in the notification panel on the right side of VSCode.

---

### 7. Install the pioarduino Platform

The environment is now ready, however **yoRadio Fusion uses the pioarduino platform**, which PlatformIO does not install automatically during the first setup.

Close **VSCode**, then start it again.

When the project loads, VSCode will detect the missing **pioarduino** platform and prompt you to install it.

Click **Install** and wait until the installation completes.

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b54b6369-de44-412f-8393-35d9c97a4cbc">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b54b6369-de44-412f-8393-35d9c97a4cbc" width="400">
</a>

After the installation is complete, restart **VSCode**.

After restarting VSCode, the **PlatformIO icon** (ant head) will temporarily change to an **IC icon**.

This indicates that PlatformIO is installing the **Arduino framework and toolchains** required by the project.

Please wait until the installation finishes. This process may take **20–25 minutes**, so please be patient.

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b15a64-2678-4258-bc03-c425492bf3e8">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b15a64-2678-4258-bc03-c425492bf3e8" width="400">
</a>

---

### 8. Final configuration

After the installation finishes, close **VSCode**.

The next step is to apply three modifications required for **language support** , **high-bitrate audio streaming**
and **configure WiFi**.

### 1. High Bitrate Audio Fix

After installing **pioarduino**, the following folder will exist:

C:\Users\ **your_username** \.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoespressif32-libs\esp32s3\lib\

In this folder replace the following files:

liblwip.a  
libesp_netif.a

with the files located in this repository:

yoRadio-main/Audio_IDF_MOD/

This modification is required for **smooth playback of high-bitrate audio streams**.

For more information, please read: [This documentation](https://github.com/VaraiTamas/yoRadio/blob/main/Lib_tools/LIB_TOOLS.md)

### 2. Display Font Fix

In the project folder you will find a directory similar to:

C:\platformio\yoRadio\.pio\libdeps\yoradio-esp32s3n16r8-ili9341\ **Adafruit GFX Library** \

Replace the file:

glcdfont.c

with the file located in:

C:\platformio\yoRadio\locale\glcdfont\ **your_language** \glcdfont.c

This modification ensures **correct display of texts and icons on the screen**.

### Important

The folders inside **.pio/libdeps/** are created based on the environment defined in **platformio.ini**:

For this reason the example folder: **yoradio-esp32s3n16r8-ili9341** may have a different name 
depending on the selected hardware configuration. 

If you use **multiple hardware configurations**, multiple folders will appear inside **libdeps**, 
and the **font modification must be applied in each of them** at first time.

### 3. Configure WiFi

Navigate to the following folder:

C:\platformio\yoRadio\data\data\

Open the file:

wifi.csv

⚠️ Do not use Excel. 

Open the file with **Notepad++** or directly in the **PlatformIO editor**.

Replace the default values: 'yourssid yourpassword'

with your own WiFi network credentials.  

The SSID and password must be separated by a **TAB**.

If you want to use the device in multiple locations, you can add additional WiFi networks on new lines.

Save the file & close.

---

### 9. Build and Upload the Firmware

Open **VSCode** and click the **Build icon** in the PlatformIO bottom toolbar.

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab0f6ff-afd3-4029-af18-a6c87c628e97">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab0f6ff-afd3-4029-af18-a6c87c628e97" width="400">
</a>

Wait until the first compilation finishes successfully.

Connect your device to the computer using a **USB cable**.

Open a **PlatformIO Terminal**

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/756aa022-0720-487e-8eac-5818e338eaa4">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/756aa022-0720-487e-8eac-5818e338eaa4" width="400">
</a>

and run the following commands:

**1.** Erease all flash: `pio run -t erase`

**2.** Upload firmware: `pio run -t upload`

**3.** Upload SPIFFS: `pio run -t uploadfs`

⚠️ The first upload may take several minutes.

**USE & ENJOY!**

---

### 10. Future Firmware Updates

For later updates you can simply use the **Upload icon** in PlatformIO.

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53d39483-74b4-4fd9-902d-8e68786d98a4">

</a>

The firmware can also be uploaded **via HTTP OTA** from the **WebUI interface**, 
on the Settings page, in the Update Firmware menu:

<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ff3e556-5947-4564-b653-7c2d466fc426">
